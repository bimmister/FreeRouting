Because I am no more maintaining the Freerouting project since 4 years and future Java versions may block my Freerouting Java Web Start application completely, I finally decided to open the source of the Freerouting project under the GNU public license version 3.

I have attached the complete source code of the Freerouting project. Please feel free downloading and using the sources according to the GPLv3 license.

FreeRoutingCLI

This modification of the FreeRouting software enables it to be run via a simple CLI interface without any user interface.
